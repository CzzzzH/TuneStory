## TuneStory

A tiny Music Game developped by **Qt**

The game only runs at **1920 * 1080** resolution and the platform of Windows.

You can make your own song charts in this game, and the guide is included in the **制谱指南.txt**

Currently the game server is down, so the user system and leaderboards are not available now. You can still play with the single game.
